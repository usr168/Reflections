How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
	It saves lots of time and efforts without going thru files line by line when files are big. 
  	It is also reliable to let machine to do it.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?        
	The history can allow us to go back any workikng versions when new versions have bugs. Therefore, 
	we don't need to spend/waste time to get it back to working condition.


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

git init
git status
git log -- stat
git diff
git config --global color.ui auto
git config --global core.editor "C:/Program\ Files/Sublime\ Text\ 2/sublime_text.exe -n -w"
git config --global push.default upstream
git config --global merge.conflictstyle diff3
